  "guidelines": {
    "Alerts": "Length: 1-2 short sentences (50-120 characters). Four types: informational (blue, 'i' icon — neutral info/tips/updates), warning (yellow, warning icon — potential issues needing attention), error (red, 'x' icon — critical issues preventing progress), success (green, checkmark — confirming successful actions). Sentence case. Clear, direct, non-alarming tone. [Action] + [Result/Impact] structure. Lead with consequence or question, follow with directive, end with outcome. Use contextual phrasing for irreversible actions ('You cannot undo this action'), question format for assistance ('Have an emergency?'), and notification references ('[Person] will be notified'). Maintain standard phrasing and consistent terminology for similar alerts. Periods at end of complete sentences.",
    "Buttons": "Length: 1-3 words (max 25 characters). Sentence case (capitalize first word only). Verb + Object preferred ('Add new insurance', 'Send payment'). Alternative: single verb/noun for common actions ('Save', 'Cancel', 'Filters'). Three types — Primary (solid blue bg + white text, strong verbs: 'Create', 'Send', 'Save'), Secondary (white bg + visible stroke, neutral verbs: 'Cancel', 'Back'), Tertiary (no fill, text only: 'Learn more', 'View details'). Be specific ('Upload faxes' not 'Upload'). Use consistent verbs for similar actions. Use '+' icon before text for creation/addition. Icon reinforces, not replaces, text. Prioritize clarity over brevity.",
    "Input Fields": "Labels: 1-3 words (noun/noun phrase), sentence case, max 25 chars. Required fields: asterisk (*) at end of label. Three types — Standard text (no placeholder, e.g. 'First name *'), Format-specific (show format: 'MM/DD/YYYY', '000-000-0000'), Selection (use 'Select' only). Placeholder max 20 chars, format guidance only, not instructions. Helper text: below field, max 50 chars, sentence case, no end punctuation, use when format too complex for placeholder. Error pattern: 'Please enter a valid [field type]', sentence case, max 40 chars, no end punctuation. Universal rules: no punctuation at end of labels/placeholders/errors, sentence case only, asterisk at end only, keep all text brief.",
    "Tooltips": "Length: 20-75 chars (simple: 20-40, complex: 40-75). Sentence case. White text on grey background. 'i' icon in circle for info tooltips. Key info first (action, object, outcome), then details (constraints, requirements). For date/time: action first, then who, when, where. For status indicators: include next steps. For form fields: include validation requirements. For disabled elements: explain why and how to enable. Icon-only buttons must have tooltips. Use tooltips for brief clarifications and field definitions. Use inline help (not tooltips) for multi-step processes. Align terminology with documentation.",
    "Table Headers": "Length: 1-2 words (max 20 characters). Title Case. Neutral, descriptive tone. Noun or short noun phrase. Examples: 'Title', 'Patients', 'Status', 'Delivery Time', 'Created', 'Specialty', 'Confidence', 'Received', 'Facility', 'Type'. No verbs. No abbreviations without established convention.",
    "Statuses": "Sentence case always ('In progress', not 'In Progress'). Be consistent across the product. Use clear, recognizable labels. No Title Case, no all caps.",
    "Modals": "Title: 2-5 words, sentence case. Body: 1-3 sentences, sentence case. Six types — Deletion ('Delete [Item Name]?' + 'This cannot be undone.'), Confirmation ('Are you sure?' + state what happens), Warning ('Are you sure?' or 'Warning' + consequences + 'This action cannot be undone'), Archive ('Are you sure?' + 'Archiving this [item] will remove it from [location]. This cannot be reversed.'), Information (brief title + 1-2 detail sentences), Success ('Workflow Created' or 'Success' + confirmation + next steps). Primary button matches title question ('Are you sure?' → 'I'm sure'). Always reference specific item affected. Include 'This cannot be undone/reversed' for destructive actions.",
    "Settings": "Name: 3-7 words, Title Case, clear and action-oriented. Description: 1-2 sentences, sentence case, direct language. Four format types — Toggle ('Enable this setting to [action] [object] in [location] [benefit].'), Selection ('Select whether [object] in [location] should [action A] or [action B].'), Information ('If using [feature], [instruction for action].'), Numeric ('What is the [quantity measure] of [action]?'). Professional, informative, slightly technical when necessary.",
    "Descriptive/General Copy": "Flexible length (typically 1-3 sentences per concept). Sentence case. Conversational but professional tone. Clear explanations with occasional brand personality. Active voice. Second person ('you'). Clarity over cleverness. Positive framing — focus on what users can do. Use 'zip code' not 'postal code'. Remove unnecessary words. No passive voice for user actions. No first person ('we', 'I'). No jargon."
